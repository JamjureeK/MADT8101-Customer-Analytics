# Designing a Customer Data Platform (CDP)
In today's data-driven business landscape, a Customer Data Platform (CDP) plays a pivotal role in creating personalized and engaging customer experiences.

## What is Customer Data Platform?
A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is like a super-smart table where you put all data together to see the whole picture of each customer. It takes data from different places, like when a customer buys something online, calls customer service, or signs up for a newsletter. The CDP then arranges all this data neatly so that you can understand each customer better.
