# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):hotel:
CLV is a crucial metric in the realm of business and marketing that quantifies the total value a customer brings to a company over the course of their entire relationship. 
It encompasses all the purchases a customer makes, the revenue they generate, and the potential future value they hold.
