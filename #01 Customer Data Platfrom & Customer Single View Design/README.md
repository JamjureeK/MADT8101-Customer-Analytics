# Customer Data Platform (CDP)

## :desktop_computer: What is Customer Data Platform?
A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a specialized platform that collects, centralizes, and organizes customer data from various sources to create a unified and comprehensive customer profile. The primary purpose of a CDP is to provide businesses with a 360-degree view of their customers, enabling data-driven marketing, personalization, and improved customer experiences.

# Single View of Customer (SVoC)

## :bar_chart: What is Single View of Customer?
SVoC is one of steps in creating CDP. It is a consolidated view of a customer's data from all sources. This means that all of the customer's data, such as their purchase history, contact information, and social media activity, is brought together in a single place. This allows businesses to have a complete and up-to-date view of each customer, which can be used to improve customer service, marketing, and sales.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Building SVoC from 'Supermarket' data
### Dataset:open_file_folder:
The initial Supermarket dataset contains 21 columns of data related to customer purchases within a supermarket. Transactions will be organized by customer code, and certain attributes will undergo feature engineering to enhance their utility for various business applications, such as customer segmentation, cross-selling, upselling, personalized marketing, and product recommendations.
