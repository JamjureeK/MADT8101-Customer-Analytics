# Customer Data Platform (CDP)

## What is Customer Data Platform?
CDP is a software platform that collects, stores, and unifies customer data from a variety of sources. It allows businesses to create a single view of their customers, which they can then use to improve marketing, sales, and customer service.

# Designing Single View of Customer (SVOC)

## What is Single View of Customer?
SVOC is a consolidated view of a customer's data from all sources. This means that all of the customer's data, such as their purchase history, contact information, and social media activity, is brought together in a single place. This allows businesses to have a complete and up-to-date view of each customer, which can be used to improve customer service, marketing, and sales.

## Turn Original Dataset to SVOC
The original Supermarket dataset contains 21 columns of information about customer purchases at a supermarket. Some features will be transformed through feature engineering to make it more useful for customer segmentation and other business applications such as personalized marketing, cross-selling and upselling, and customer service improvement.
