# Customer Data Platform (CDP)

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: What is Customer Data Platform?
A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a specialized platform that collects, centralizes, and organizes customer data from various sources to create a unified and comprehensive customer profile. The primary purpose of a CDP is to provide businesses with a 360-degree view of their customers, enabling data-driven marketing, personalization, and improved customer experiences.

## Six Stages of Customer Data Platform




# Designing Single View of Customer (SVOC)

## What is Single View of Customer?
SVOC is a consolidated view of a customer's data from all sources. This means that all of the customer's data, such as their purchase history, contact information, and social media activity, is brought together in a single place. This allows businesses to have a complete and up-to-date view of each customer, which can be used to improve customer service, marketing, and sales.

## Turn Original Dataset to SVOC
The original Supermarket dataset contains 21 columns of information about customer purchases at a supermarket. Some features will be transformed through feature engineering to make it more useful for customer segmentation and other business applications such as personalized marketing, cross-selling and upselling, and customer service improvement.
